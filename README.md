## About Me<br>
I'm David, a student at the University of Applied Sciences in Rijeka, Croatia. I have a passion for coding, particularly in web development. While I have a strong foundation in traditional HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript,
I'm also expanding my skill set by learning React and Express. My goal is to create dynamic and innovative web applications that are easy to use but not so easy to make.

## Project Overview<br>
